You are answering the following query based on retrieved domain knowledge:

**{query}**

The retrieved content below comes from 3GPP and ORAN documents. It may be fragmented, redundant, or partially relevant.

Please:
- Interpret the key ideas from the retrieved text,
- Synthesize them into an academic-style paragraph or structured list,
- Do not include general background ‚Äî focus only on what's supported by the evidence.

Avoid bullet-point summaries unless it's necessary for clarity. Focus on clarity, completeness, and directness.
